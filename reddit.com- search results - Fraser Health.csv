Four separate doctors/surgeons stated upon my departure that it was ""unlikely "" that I would ever walk again. After spending much of 2021 with a Fraser Health Care physio, I regained some hand and arm movement in addition to leg response. Worked on both for 2021 and in 2022 , took my first steps. The impossible! Built on these accomplishments to a walker and then to a cane. I can walk unassisted for 1.5 km each morning and am actively pushing ahead. Hope to take our two German Shepherds for strolls soon once my balance confidence returns. Yes, 2022 was and remains a memorable year! Ken"

To add onto it and give as much backstory as I can remember, some years back, there was a particularly big story about Brendan Frasier regarding some sort of divorce settlement with his wife where it was disclosed that his wife demanded millions and millions from the actor... despite him not acting for a long time! People wondered how he could afford it and the talk got so big, his ex-wife somehow heard of it and publicly stated he ""could afford it."" Nobody really believed it, but more importantly, nobody cared about her greed. From there, an outcrying of support came from Reddit, and in typical Reddit fashion, people starting post more about the actor. People learned that he stopped acting after developing physical injuries from the filming of the Mummy films and had to take a break for his own health. People then starting talking about how much they loved the actor (spoiler warning: I do, too, and remember this time in reddit) and people started to try and show their support for him, even by trying use social media to put him in the new Mummy reboot that Tom Cruise starred in. Brendan Frasier either wasn't considered for the role or wasn't sure if his body could handle it (or both) and the movie went on to star Tom Cruise to a less-than-ecstatic reception."

It's impossible to find a place to live at a reasonable price and even you manage to, they will ensure that you have a good credit rating (700+) otherwise they really are unlikely to let you live anywhere. A lot of people here are extremely entitled, passive aggressive and just have atrocious snobby attitudes. It gets better the further North you go in places like Bella Coola, but then you run into the problem of having absolutely nothing to do but fishing, hiking or hunting. So unless you enjoy any of those three, you're generally shit out of luck. Vancouver (Including the Greater Vancouver area), Surrey, Abbotsford, Chilliwack and Kelowna are all fucking boiling pot shit-filled cesspools full of scrap and catalytic converter thieves, tweakers, headers, creeps and others. I honestly would not recommend moving to any of those places as they will become near unliveable for anyone without a good job or inheritance, that and they're just plain shit. It used to be a beautiful place but they've turned it into a nightmare of a place to live, building houses, apartments and condos everywhere that the rich are using to play the housing market with. They shut down one of the only institutions that was helping rehabilitate and keep the severe mental health cases off the street, it was known as Riverview. Once that shut down all of the crazy ass motherfuckers started pouring out all over the Fraser Valley and Greater Vancouver Area stirring an absolute shitstorm everywhere. Now the only time you will see Riverview being used, it's for horror movies as it's run-down. As much as the Federal Government would like to say they're doing stuff to help, they really aren't and have been doing nothing but lining their pockets even more, allowing this shit to happen. They don't care about the lower-middle class whatsoever except for using them as virtue signalling trophies, acting like they're doing something so they can show it on the media and have bootlickers voting for them who have zero clue how bad it actually is because they're living that entitled life where they can buy luxury products and go out to eat every goddamn day rather than making a meal. Don't encourage the Provincial Government or Federal Government by moving to BC, move elsewhere and save yourself the money and headache. You won't have to deal with snobby rich fucks and the spastic homeless who absolutely hate you for existing and having a job and not sparing them a damn cigarette or dollar when you don't even have one yourself. Not to mention the hospitals are absolutely filled to the brim and you'll almost always be waiting at least 4-6 hours in the waiting room if you ever need to go. There's no two-tiered health system so you almost always will be waiting unless it's urgent care and you're quite literally minutes away from dying. People also drive like absolute fucking maniacs here, are extremely rude to pedestrians quite often and there are consistent road rage incidents and hit and runs. BC is a vitriolic shithole. Unless you want to move North I would never ever support a province like this. It's a beautiful place but needs an entire face-lift and new management.

The assault, his subsequent divorce, and the death of his mother launched Fraser into a depression that, combined with his health issues, led to a pause in his career.[53][58] Several publications and social media users interpreted that Fraser was ""blacklisted"" from Hollywood for speaking out about the sexual assault.[59] However, Fraser said he would not use the term and was doubtful that the decline in his career had anything to do with the incident. In his 2019 appearance on the radio show Sway in the Morning, Fraser said ""I don't think the HFPA really wield that much power. This was not an executive, this was a former president of that organisation which is essentially journalists.""[60]"
